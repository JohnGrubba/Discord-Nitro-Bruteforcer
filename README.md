This is only meant to showcase how a bruteforcer works! I have made it similar to many others out there, but better!
I hope you like it!

If you really want to get a working code you will need to have a pretty good internet connection and a not too bad PC or Laptop to run it 24/7!
The Chances of really getting a working code are really low but who knows? Maybe your first code is already a working one?

# DISCORD NITRO BRUTEFORCER!

Copyright Jonas Grubbauer 2020

This is only meant to showcase how a bruteforcer works! I have made it similar to many others out there, but better!
I hope you like it!

If you really want to get a working code you will need to have a pretty good internet connection and a not too bad PC or Laptop to run it 24/7!
The Chances of really getting a working code are really low but who knows? Maybe your first code is already a working one?

# INSTALLATION
1) Download Pythons latest Version from https://www.python.org/
2) Go into the Command Prompt and type this: pip install requests
3) https://i.imgur.com/w3a3tGv.png
4) Go into your cloned folder and click on the path!
5) Type in cmd and hit enter
6) Type in the Command Prompt: python main.py
7) Program will Launch!

# UPDATES
# V1
1) Generating random Discord Nitro Gift Keys and saving them into a .txt File!
2) Then checking these codes!
3) Very unsafe checker! It says INVALID, even if there is no internet connection or it hasn't even checked it yet!
4) Working fast and non Stop! (May skip working codes!)
# V2
Things added / removed in V2:
1) No File to save the generated Codes to! It directly checks them so no need to save them!
2) Added Rate Limit Error Code!
3) Added improved checker!
4) It will never skip a working code! (There's no way!)
5) Improved GUI!
# V3
Things added in V3:
1) Made a real GUI! (Has still some bugs)

PS: Use VPN to prevent "Rate Limit" Error Code!
# IMPORTANT
I tried to make a proxy feature but:
1) It is slow as hell! Would take years for a single code!
2) Who has that many proxys to bruteforce millions of codes?
These are the main reasons i won't update anymore!
